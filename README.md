# HW10
This repository contains the solutions to Week 12 homework for STA365. The assignment includes three questions, each exploring advanced Bayesian modeling topics such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Variational Inference (VI) using PyMC.

Question 1: Gaussian Processes and Variational Inference

This question defines Gaussian Processes (GPs) and provides an overview of stochastic processes in general. It also introduces variational inference and the concept of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) for approximating complex posterior distributions.

Question 2: Gaussian Processes Demonstration

This question repurposes PyMC documentation to demonstrate Gaussian Processes on a dataset different from the original PyMC examples. The aim is to show how GPs can be flexibly applied to new contexts using the same core methods.

Question 3: Variational Inference with Neural Networks

This question uses PyMC to fit a neural network model with variational inference on a new dataset. It highlights how the ELBO framework can be used to train neural networks in a Bayesian setting.
